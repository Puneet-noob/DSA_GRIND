/*

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].



[1,    2,    3,    4,    5]
[1,    1,    2,    6,    24]
[120,  60,   20,   5,     1]
